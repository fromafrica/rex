# what's rex?

This is a blazingly fast frontend framework that's powered by web components.

Despite what you may have heard, Web Components are easy to work with. No wrapper library necessary.

Install it & see for yourself. `npx create-rex-app@latest`

[Or try it in your browser here](https://stackblitz.com/github/fromafrica/create-rex-app).


The roadmap for rex includes a dev server (you literally have to manually refresh like a caveman right now), Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and a tiny build step to minify the final javascript payload for optimal performance.

There is also a backend server framework written in Rust that's meant to be an optional compliment to this frontend framework. [You can find the repo for that here.](https://github.com/fromafrica/rexserver)
