# what's rex?

This is a frontend framework that's powered by web components.

You use TypeScript + Tailwind to do amazing work & write code blazingly fast.

Web Components are easy to work with. No wrapper library necessary.

Install it & see for yourself. [Try it in your browser here](https://stackblitz.com/github/fromafrica/rex).

The roadmap for rex includes a dev server (you literally have to manually refresh like a caveman right now), HMR, and a tiny build step to minify the final javascript payload for optimal performance.
